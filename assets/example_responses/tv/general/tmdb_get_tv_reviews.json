        "content": "I started watching when it came out as I heard that fans of LOTR also liked this. I stopped watching after Season 1 as I was devastated lol kinda. Only 2015 I decided to continue watching and got addicted like it seemed complicated at first, too many stories and characters. I even used a guide from internet like family tree per house while watching or GOT wiki so I can have more background on the characters. For a TV series, this show can really take you to a different world and never knowing what will happen. It is very daring that any time anybody can just die (I learned not to be attached and have accepted that they will all die so I won't be devastated hehe). I have never read the books but the show is entertaining and you will really root for your faves and really hate on those you hate. \r\n\r\nFantasy, action, drama, comedy, love...and lots of surprises!",

        "content": "Cruel, bloody, vulgar, Machiavellian, unrepentant. And that is just the writing. The camera angles, the score, the pacing mesh together for grand storytelling: a mix of horror, swords and sorcery, and endless treachery. \r\n\r\nAnd all of that would be somewhat squandered if it wasn't for the best casting I've ever seen. From Lena Headey as soft spoken Cersei to Peter Vaughan as ancient Maester Aemon, each character pulses with depth and believability. Peter Dinklage may have sacrificed a virgin princess to get this role; I've never seen a better fit, not in size (though there is that) but in the way his eyes convey shrewd arrogance coupled with unabashed debauchery.",

There's no such thing as a happy ending, or an ending for that matter (unless you're dead). So as you watch the show make predictions, draw conspiracy theories, and watch them blow up in your face. This show is that kind of a ride!",

        "content": "This series starts off like some of the best out there. Although it makes some minor adjustments, it follows the story from the books quite faithfully for the first 4 seasons. And adds a twinkle of big budget movies, and great cinematography. Truly awesome. Up until this point, I was in love with the series, a 10/10. I quickly read all the books, and re-watched all seasons before a new one would come out.\r\n\r\nHowever, from season 5 and onwards, it starts going downhill. They ran out of book-material, and it shows. Everything starts focusing on the big set-pieces, characters become extremely bland and predictable. From here all major characters receive plot-armor, which was one of the things it didn't have before, and that made it interesting to watch. Of course they want you to think that they will still kill some of the main characters, but they're just teasing.\r\n\r\nThe last few seasons I've only been watching to see what the conclusion to this story is, but I cringe and writhe during every episode I watch. What a pitiful way to go out. Hopefully the books finish the story in a more interesting and believable way.",

        "content": "Before watching this TV show I was told that it's best TV show ever. I'm big fan of Vikings TV series and when I asked opinion about GOT to my friend, he said Vikings is nothing compared to GOT. All my coworkers are GOT addicts, so finally I gave it a try. I watched all 8 seasons, so I'm quite qualified to review it: It wasn't bad TV show. Actually it was quite good with interesting characters, but it wasn't as good as I was told and I personally don't agree on that statement that it's better than Vikings. Most interesting parts where around queen Daenerys. This TV show gets tense after season 7, however things don't go like we wanted and ending is awfully bad. Basically, this TV show is ruined by stupidly bad ending which leaves you quite upset. In short, GOT is good TV show (not great), ruined by bad ending.",

That said, on January last year I decided to binge watch all of it.\r\nFirst 10 minutes of the first episode left me in awe and as I kept watching I finally understood why everybody loved it.\r\nEach episode left me in shock and awe. From shocking character deaths to epic battle scenes. Some of the characters I loved, while a few I hated and glad they finally died.\r\n\r\nSeries 8, as I've finally catched up. I was honestly left disappointed with the ending - and I'd hoped they would save the Nightwalker battle for the last two episodes. Nevertheless, this series was a decent way to end the franchise.\r\n\r\nYour watch has ended.",

        "content": "I decided to give this a try due to all of the acclaim it received. I smile when I remember seeing a review for another great show that had a higher rating than Game of Thrones, and the reviewer said that the other show was a good show but he gave it just one star because he couldn’t believe it was ranked higher than GOT. I thought, I guess I need to watch this Thrones show that has such rabid devotees.\r\n\r\nI expected a sort of Lord of the Rings on steroids, but I don’t know what drug it is on. The settings and characters are realistic, and the Machiavellian plot lines seems to make sense to me for a while.  As the series went on, however, my interest began to flag a bit. Some of the characters that seemed complex at the outset, devolved into predictable two-dimensional stereotypes. And my stars, the number of rapes going on. I recognize that in such society rape was probably commonplace, but it was likely so in Ancient Rome also, and yet the great series Rome found other ways to titillate than the one-trick pony of forced entry.\r\n\r\nSo I confess I didn’t make it to the end of the show, but from what I hear, even big fans of the show were let down by how it all wound down.",
