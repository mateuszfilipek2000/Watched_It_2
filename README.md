# Watched It 2

"Watched It 2 (or too!)" is my second attempt at creating The Movie Database client. The previous one quickly got really messy, that's why I am completely redoing all of the code! The major difference between this, and the previous one, is different approach to state management - this one is using flutter bloc. I hope that this one will turn out better than the previous one... anyhoo I am still learning, so there will probably be a lot of boilerplate code, I'll appreciate any advices!
