Batman” Is A Very Engaging And Unforgettable Tale That Is One Of The Best Adaptations Of The Character Ever\r\n\r\nIn 1989 Michael Keaton was seen as a very controversial choice to wear the Cowl of Batman but soon proved his doubters wrong by turning “Batman” and its subsequent sequel “Batman Returns” into massive Box Office success before leaving the cape behind.\r\n\r\nWhile four other actors have taken up the cinematic version of the character in the subsequent years, Keaton has remained for many the Gold Standard with Christian Bale likely being his biggest rival.\r\n\r\nWhen Robert Pattinson was named as the new Batman, there was interest but concern as an actor who is largely known for playing Edward in the “Twilight” films seemed to be an odd choice. However, I would say that anyone who has seen some of his recent work including his performance in “The Lighthouse” would be playing him a disservice by saying he was not up to the part.\r\n\r\nIn “The Batman”, audiences are given a darker and more broken Bruce Wayne, an Emo recluse who is far from the Socialite he has been portrayed as for decades and a very sullen and withdrawn individual who does not exude charm or grace and even shows issues making eye-contact.\r\n\r\nWhen the Mayor of Gotham is killed shortly before the election by a mysterious individual known as “The Riddler” (Paul Dano), the vigilante known as “The Batman” is called in to help the police by Lt. James Gordon (Jeffrey Wright).  Gordon has been working with Batman for some time but it is clear that his association with him has not won him any favors with his fellow officers, many of which openly question his use and involvement in the crime scenes.\r\n\r\nFurther complicating matters are clues left at the various crime locales that are addressed to The Batman and cause many to believe that he may be working with the very killer they are attempting to stop.\r\n\r\nAs the investigation unfolds, the seedy side of Gotham City comes to light in the form of a missing girl who was photographed with the married Mayor and may well be the key to the investigation. Her disappearance leads her friend Selina Kyle (Zoe Kravitz), to take on her Catwoman persona and delve deep into an underworld that features deadly individuals ranging from Carmine Falcone (John Turturro), and The Penguin (Colin Farrell), amongst others as she and the Batman conduct their own investigations that at times overlap and further complicate matters.\r\n\r\nAs the body count rises and Batman races to find the true method behind the madness of The Riddler, the tone becomes darker and more sinister in a deadly race against time.\r\n\r\nThe film eschews the usual abundance of action sequences and glossy special effects which are common for Comic Book related films and instead gives audiences a slow-burning murder mystery that holds your attention from start to finish over its three-hour run time.\r\n\r\nThe dark and foreboding tone of the film is brought home by the haunting and sharp piano keys of the film’s theme that permeates the film and punches home that this is a film clearly aimed at a more adult audience.\r\n\r\nPattinson does a great job showing the deeply broken individual that is behind the mask and that Batman is the only form of escape or therapy that Bruce Wayne has due to his insistence on saving a city that many argue cannot be saved. He has strained his relationship at times with Alfred (Andy Serkis), caused damage to the financial stability and reputation of the family company in his quest for vengeance and justice, and has become a bitter and broken recluse in doing so. In many ways, it could be argued that his only socialization with others is as The Batman and his single-minded obsession is chilling to watch.\r\n\r\nPattinson also handles the action sequences well as the film spaces them out to put the emphasis more on the man than the gadgets as they are kept to a minimum even during a thrilling chase with the new version of The Batmobile.\r\n\r\nThe strong supporting cast works well with the film and Paul Dano gives a very compelling and disturbing version of his character which makes the film even darker and more engrossing.\r\n\r\nDirector Matt Reeves has crafted a dark and foreboding tone and visual style as a good portion of the film takes place in the darkness and his screenplay is not afraid to take chances by putting the emphasis on the characters and their flaws versus an abundance of action and effects.\r\n\r\nI found this version of the character and interpretation more engrossing than prior versions of the film as the bold move to do a slow-burning and dark murder mystery versus an effect-laden action film reminded me of some of the better Batman stories such as Batman: The Killing Joke or Batman: The Long Halloween.\r\n\r\nThe film is not going to be for everyone, especially younger viewers and some may take issue with the casting choices, but their performances shine and as such, “The Batman” was a very engaging and unforgettable tale that for me serves as one of the best adaptations of the character ever.\r\n\r\n4 stars out of 5","created_at":"2022-02-28T17:12:37.932Z","id":"621d02856b5fc2006b954bab","updated_at":"2022-02-28T17:12:37.932Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/621d02856b5fc2006b954bab"},{"author":"mooney240","author_details":{"name":"","username":"mooney240","avatar_path":"/nubUVTiswPmP77I8kpDPMb9okJK.jpg","rating":8.0},"content":"The reviews and hype for this movie were massive!

Matt Reeves made some genius creative choices among which were the more reclusive rockstar grungy Bruce Wayne and the Riddler being heavily influenced by the Zodiac.  The acting was fantastic as well with Zoe Kravitz and Paul Dano offering some standout performances.  The Batman is driven with psychological and mystery focus as compared to the action comedy style of most superhero movies.  My only complaint is that the mystery felt fairly predictable.

Matt Reeves delivers a distinctly darker, more intense, frighteningly realistic noir thriller than past adaptations, with an aggressively vengeful Bruce Wayne / Batman and a fear-inducing, mysterious, lunatic Riddler.\r\n\r\nGreig Fraser's cinematography - bone-chilling \"ins-and-outs\" of Batman and stunning footage of Gotham - and Michael Giacchino's score - genuinely addictive, elevates the entire film - make this adaptation the best-looking and best-scored cinematic version of the Batman ever.\r\n\r\nEven with the narrative focus on the detective work, the action sequences are exhilarating and beautifully shot. The entire cast is extraordinary, especially Paul Dano and Robert Pattinson - the latter destroys all skepticism around his talent.\r\n\r\nApart from a short period at the end of the second act, the three hours fly by.

Having Batman and Jim Gordon both speak in raspy, whispery grunts feels excessive as does Gordon’s insistence on calling Batman, “Chief,” every time that they’re together. The film deserves credit for prominently shining the spotlight on the underbelly of crime in Gotham, but the storytelling in _The Batman_ is a lot like Bugs Bunny meaning to have taken that left turn at Albuquerque; a meandering foray down a dark rabbit hole that isn’t entirely necessary.\r\n\r\n**Full review:** https://hubpages.com/entertainment/The-Batman-2022-Review-When-is-a-Bat-Not-Quite-a-Bat","created_at":"2022-03-06T01:50:57.237Z","id":"62241381b84f940045446a10","updated_at":"2022-03-06T01:50:57.237Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/62241381b84f940045446a10"},{"author":"edwecks","author_details":{"name":"","username":"edwecks","avatar_path":null,"rating":10.0},"content":"Masterpiece.

This is the definitive live-action Batman. An epic 3-hour film noir that delves deep into comic lore of Gotham City.\r\n\r\nRobert Pattinson perfectly embodies both Bruce Wayne and Batman. I love the character arc he goes through, realizing Gotham doesn't need vengeance to heal, but hope. Zoë Kravitz plays a phenomenal Selina Kyle, you actually feel her emotions throughout the movie. Another plus is that she actually feels integral to the plot (unlike The Dark Knight Rises). Paul Dano is a terrifyingly realistic interpretation of The Riddler, using the internet to gain a fan base for his sick games. Andy Serkis plays an excellent Alfred, being Bruce's emotional support during Dark times.\r\n\r\nThe soundtrack by Michael Giacchino is absolute God-Tier. Elevating every scene with emotion and sometimes dread. Finally a score to rival Danny Elfman's iconic score.

I'll get this out the way early: I'd say <em>'<a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/batman-begins/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Batman Begins</a>'</em>/'<a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/the-dark-knight/\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Dark Knight</a>'</em> are superior, not by much, which is a similar case for the character performances too.\r\n\r\nRobert Pattinson is a terrific Bruce Wayne, though Christian Bale still edges him out in my eyes. Zoë Kravitz is probably the best Catwoman I've seen, though the rest - from the Riddler to Penguin to Alfred - have been portrayed better; aside from Commissioner Gordon, with Jeffrey Wright being excellent. Paul Dano is the least enjoyable performer, for me, here, I found his showing to be a bit 'meh' - effective, but meh. Barry Keoghan makes a cameo, I won't say as who, but I don't hold high hopes for him in that role; though, <a href=\"https://variety.com/2022/film/news/the-batman-ending-joker-barry-keoghan-matt-reeves-1235196812/#:~:text=While%20it%20may,more%20%E2%80%9CBatman%E2%80%9D%20movies.\" rel=\"nofollow\">apparently</a> it won't be anything that happens anyway. For the best!\r\n\r\nAnyway... the above sounds <em>way</em> too negative - as I did thoroughly and absolutely enjoy this film, hence the very positive rating. The pacing is very good, the cinematography is brilliant (Gotham looks fantastically bleak!), the story is engrossing and the dialogue is on point. The scenes with Pattinson/Kravitz and Pattinson/Wright are my favourite moments. It's a film that I'd consider as 'outstanding'.\r\n\r\nIt'll be cool to see what Reeves does with this trilogy (should it happen, of course).","created_at":"2022-03-18T02:20:51.206Z","id":"6233ec8303bf84001c6cb00d","updated_at":"2022-03-18T02:20:51.206Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/6233ec8303bf84001c6cb00d"},{"author":"Tatsky","author_details":{"name":"","username":"Tatsky","avatar_path":"/https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/15b623722f19c0fea3949afeba92d4bc.jpg","rating":8.0},"content":"I like how Batman is depicted with a naive and loser POV from his rich high tower, a rich trust fund baby called out by both sane (Catwoman) and insane (Riddler) people while he remains oblivious until the consequences are literally flooding the city. While he uses the idea of Batman as a mantle for him to process trauma, his obliviousness to his own celebrity status and image creates unintentional side effects from his parents' death hogging the spotlight away from the people that mattered to his own nebulous idea of \"vengeance\" being co-opted by the goons, a heel-turn realization that eventually changes the rack focus, ultimately leading to a wider perspective and a selfless act of cutting the cord and helping others. Hope is more important than his idea of justice, in the end, empathy being the missing piece throughout. Instead of being a voyeur like Riddler during his master plan (Riddler binoculars on the mayor, Batman binoculars on Catwoman), he switches to being on the ground to help, no longer from his high castle.\r\n\r\nIt's interesting how this arc plays out. At the beginning, it plays into this \"badass\" idea comic book fans love to gloat about Batman of striking fear into crime, but the way it's portrayed is frightening to everyone. It's a better criticism of Batman's fascism than BvS was going for, showcasing his fear to people who don't even deserve it, such as kids doing vandalism who probably believe the system is failing them, but to him at the beginning crime all looks the same.\r\n\r\nHonestly this film goes harder than Phantasm on the tragedy that is Bruce Wayne. They're inseparable by choice, to the point that Bruce basically is Batman even when not in the costume, a social recluse who can barely function in real life, listening to emo music and having rings around his eyes, a night owl to the extreme. The struggle is there even as Batman, literally smashing his face on a truck.\r\n\r\nThere are some contradictions throughout thematically, however. It's weird how it goes between \"it's the WHOLE system, all cops are pigs\" to \"it's just bad apples\" simultaneously, displaying a somewhat cringe centrism. Catwoman by the end basically points it more to systemic (and Batman and Thomas Wayne's criticism of thinking they know better and actually makings things worse isn't undercut, which by itself is also institutional criticism), although it still feels like they could've done more. Maybe out of their hands by the studio or this as far as they could get away with vs. the producers (it almost felt like a struggle for Catwoman to outline her \"eat the rich\" mentality). Gotham itself is a mess of contradictions and it's OK to let the viewer lie between it all I guess.\r\n\r\nAlso the relationship between Catwoman and Batman is kinda slimy and male-centric. Catwoman, while great as a character, functionally falls to Batman's controlling force with a forced romance in the second act. Sure they're both suffering from trauma but Batman was literally using her despite it all, it at least understands the power gap more in the third act.\r\n\r\nThe end of the second act also spins its wheels a bit too much, the mystery pace kinda suffers a bit from focus and scenes get too drawn out (Riddler just disappears for a while). The movie could've been 20 minutes shorter. Doesn't stop it from having a terrific third act since most blockbusters have kinda sucked on that note\r\nAlthough speaking of Riddler, master class. Probably my favorite villain in a Batman film. \r\n\r\nThe aesthetic was gorgeous. I love its color grading and architecture, still thinking of the Wayne tower and its metal grates, goth hallways, and insane attention to detail that gets blurred out intentionally in the frame for most of the movie by Bruce's obliviousness to the world. It also keeps a balance of evoking the black/white movies while still being colorful, more of flooded black and oranges. I think of that sequence with Penguin not mainly for the fight itself (which to me was a bit messy) but moreso the flooded orange of the fire being the only color creating a sorta gradient on the black car, and how the flare at the end matches that aesthetic, that one color illuminating Batman leading everybody else to exit the frame, like a light in the darkness. Lovely\r\n\r\nThe music.... Giacchino just beat out his Incredibles score for me, masterful work with motifs, percussion, and rhythm. His mastery of percussion and horns during the lights out Batman hallway fight and how the horns blast, how well edited the percussion beat subtly goes through the Penguin chase and other fight sequences, Batman doesn't quite have a dance like Hong Kong films but the music makes it come close. The timpani and strings are so well used!!! Great use of Ave Maria both as soundtrack and score. Catwoman's motif? Amazing.\r\n\r\nThe performances are great all around. Finally a film with Turturro that I don't hate him. He's well restrained and perfectly cast, his dickish attitude now a strong point making him very memorable with very little screen time, much like Farrell in the same film. Kravitz made me the closest to tearing up with how she visually handles conflicting emotions, I still think about that scene with the voicemail where her eyes are all over the place and has trouble keeping it all together. Dano as Riddler is terrific.\r\n\r\nYep, this is my fav Batman film now.","created_at":"2022-03-27T15:39:50.559Z","id":"624085464cbe12005d584bd9","updated_at":"2022-03-28T15:38:17.308Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/624085464cbe12005d584bd9"},{"author":"aquiluus","author_details":{"name":"","username":"aquiluus","avatar_path":"/1ObeCO0rKmf97uOjzRtwLPbAY9K.jpg","rating":10.0},"content":"This film is so intricate, there's so many details, things you can obverse on multiple watches and not have noticed on your first. There's a lot of things that just aren't spoken that give this film so much substance. So many layers and nuanced story telling. Gotham City feels as it should, as it's own character and a visceral cesspool of corruption and just dirt. It feels dirty, unpolished... it's amazing.\r\n\r\nThere's so many shots in this film that are just simply breathtaking and intentionally dirty. It helps capture this visceral tone and fits substantially well with the universe of Batman.\r\n\r\nBeing a diehard fan of Batman for, like, pretty much all of my life- I have to say; Matt Reeves absolutely nailed it with a completely faithful adaptation of Batman. Not once in this movie did he do something I felt was completely out of character and Robert Pattinson solidified the performance of both Bruce Wayne and the Batman. I love Matt Reeves went to the extent to make sure this Batman doesn't kill, as other directors have seem to give less care to. Yes, even Nolan. It should have to go without saying that Batman does not kill, that's a no-brainer, but for decades this has been a problem in Batman films... and finally, it no longer is a problem. That's how you do it.\r\n\r\nBringing this review to a conclusion, this is easily my favourite Batman film. So many things about this film just feel like it's pulled straight out of a comic book. I mean, Riddler flooding the city itself is pulled straight from Zero Year and there's so many nods to comic moments and members of Batman's rouges gallery. Matt Reeves knew what he was doing, and he crafted this film for diehard Batman fans, succeeding immensely. Can't wait to see more of this universe.","created_at":"2022-04-01T17:52:30.345Z","id":"62473bdefd6fa1004e5031e7","updated_at":"2022-04-19T22:31:51.725Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/62473bdefd6fa1004e5031e7"},{"author":"CinemaSerf","author_details":{"name":"CinemaSerf","username":"Geronimo1967","avatar_path":"/1kks3YnVkpyQxzw36CObFPvhL5f.jpg","rating":6.0},"content":"OK, shoot me now - but you can tell when you are watching a film at the cinema and the audience start to get a bit restless. Well mine did with this overlong, and frankly rather dreary film. The opening few, somewhat dystopian, scenes reminded me of \"Blade Runner\" (1982) and we do hit the ground running. Amidst an hotly contested mayoral election, a chap in a gas mask (\"The Riddler\", we learn later) brutally takes out the sitting candidate enticing the \"Batman\" (Robert Pattinson) to come help his policeman pal \"Gordon\" (Jeffrey Wright) to investigate. Seems that the killer wanted that to happen because he leaves our caped crusader a card with a clue. Soon the great and the good of the city are dropping like flies and a web of corruption and deceit at the top echelons of government is emerging. Personally I found this all a bit dull. It flows terribly slowly, and after a while the relentless darkness and a really pretty soporific, moody, effort from Pattinson just started to bore me. There are loads of plot holes - not least just how the \"Riddler\" manages to pull off some pretty heavy duty crimes without having to scale any tall buildings, or sneak past the heavily guarded victims of his spree. The scenes with the completely unprotected DA (Peter Sarsgaard) in a dimly lit street are just plain daft. Colin Farrell is probably my highlight as the duplicitous \"Oz\", and Zoë Kravitz (\"Cat Woman”) offers us some decent acrobatics but otherwise, this is an hugely over-rated affair that has a serious paucity of dialogue, is heavily scored and during it's almost three hours, not enough actually happens. Indeed, it is very reluctant to let us leave. I will admit that my first guess at the ending was a bit optimistic, but it could conclude at least another four times before we are finally allowed to stretch our legs. It might look better second time around, but for now it's nothing at all to write home about.","created_at":"2022-04-04T16:42:24.863Z","id":"624b1ff015a4a1006381e9cc","updated_at":"2022-04-04T16:42:24.863Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/624b1ff015a4a1006381e9cc"},{"author":"JPV852","author_details":{"name":"","username":"JPV852","avatar_path":"/xNLOqXXVJf9m7WngUMLIMFsjKgh.jpg","rating":8.0},"content":"Good albeit not great, this newest incarnation of Batman is well done if not also incredibly dark.
